# vSSH CLI
vSSH CLI is a command line utility designed to simplify generation and enrollment of machine identities for SSH access. System administrators can enroll SSH certificates from Venafi SSH Protect and use them to connect to their infrastructure. vSSH CLI can be used to enroll SSH certificates for applications and hosts.

## Compatibility
